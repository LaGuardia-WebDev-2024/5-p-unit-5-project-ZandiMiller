        <span class="first-sentence">
          The series follows Eleanor Shellstrop, a dead woman who is placed in a
          Heaven-like utopian afterlife designed and supervised by
          Michael.</span

        However, Eleanor knows she did not deserve to get into the Good Place,
        as she lived a dishonorable life. To avoid being found out and sent to
        the Bad Place, Eleanor attempts to hide her imperfect past behavior
        while trying to become a more ethical person.

      <h2>Who Is In <i>The Good Place</i>?</h2>
      <h3>
        <span class="first-sentence"
          >The <i>The Good Place</i> tenants consist of Eleanor Shellstrop,
          Chidi Anagonye, Tahani Al-Jamil, and Jason Mendoza.</span
        >
        These are four people who we've selected to spend their afterlife in
        <i>The Good Place</i> because of their good behaviors that they
        contributed on earth. Protagonist Eleanor initially is mistakenly sent
        to the Good Place, so she hides this and decides to study ethics solely
        for self-preservation. She begins to gradually become more selfless and
        thoughtful as time goes by. Chidi's overwhelming knowledge of ethics
        often caused him to obsess over whether even his most insignificant
        actions were ethical. Tahani is exceptionally attractive and very
        fashionable; she was raised in high society England, and consequently
        was very well-educated. Jason was often considered dumb and was a
        misguided man who had major impulse issues.

      <h2>What Is The Bad Place?</h2>

        <span class="first-sentence"
          >"The Bad Place" is essentially the equivalent of hell.</span
        >
        It's where individuals go if their actions during their lives result in
        a net-negative moral score. The Bad Place is portrayed as a realm of
        eternal punishment and torment, but the show also uses it as a satirical
        critique of traditional concepts of the afterlife.

      <h2>Who Will I Play In Our One Act Version Of <i>The Good Place</i>?</h2>
      <h3>
        <span class="first-sentence"
          >I‚Äôm so excited to play Chidi in our One Act performance on December
          11th!</span
        >
        We‚Äôve pieced together the first and last episodes of season one to
        create one overarching story. Getting into Chidi‚Äôs character along with
        his moral dilemmas, his anxious quirks, and his heart for helping others
        is such a rewarding challenge. I love how this condensed version
        captures the core of the show‚Äôs humor and its deeper philosophical
        questions. Bringing that to life on stage would usually be difficult,
        but our drama department can pull off anything. I can‚Äôt wait to see how
        it all comes together.
